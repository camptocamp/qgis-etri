Installation
------------
steps 1 and 2 are optional and can be done only once before distributing the plugin archive
1) build the plugin (python Qt tools required -> pip install PyQt5):
     make
2) generate the plugin package
     make zip
3) the generated zip file qgis_etri.zip can be distributed and installed in QGIS:
   In the QGIS menu bar, go to: Plugins -> Manage and Install Plugins...
   In the dialog select the tab 'Install from ZIP' and choose the zip file
4) After this step an icon should appear in the plugin bar.
   To use it click on the icon and the ELECTRE-TRI window should
   appear...

Development installation
------------------------
On a linux development machine, a lighter installation can be done, by creating a symbolic link from source code to QGIS plugin folder:
    make link

There are also make recipes to build and install a local package
    make install
and to remove an existing plugin
    make uninstall

Development hints
-----------------
Make UI changes in the ui files (ui/main_window.ui and ui/inference_results.ui), then rebuild th plugin via `make all`

Usage
-----
1. When you start the plugin, a window with several tabs will be displayed.
The first thing to do is to choose the vector layer containing the actions
evaluated on the different criteria of the problem. This is done by
selecting the corresponding entry in the list box and then by clicking on
the load layer button.
2. After loading the layer, the different attributes of the layer will be
displayed in the criteria tab. Deselect attributes that are not criteria
of the model. For the criteria of the problem, you can change the weights
and the direction (if its a criterion to maximize or to minimize).
3. If you tick the checkbox Exort Source Fields, you can select/deselect
fields in column 4, which will be exported to the generated output file
4. Once the criteria parameters defined, you can define the profile and
thresholds of the ELECTRE TRI model in the second tab.
5. Finally choose a cut level in the box on the right and then you can
generate the decision map by clicking on the corresponding button.
